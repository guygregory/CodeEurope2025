# Code Europe 2025 - 1st July 2025

## Getting Started with Azure AI Foundry Agent Service

> Azure AI Foundry Agent Service is a fully-managed AI platform that combines powerful models, numerous tools, and enterprise data connectivity, enabling you to build agentic AI solutions at scale. In this session, you’ll learn how to get started using both the Azure AI Foundry portal and the Python SDK. Discover how the service differs from Chat Completions, Assistants API, and Responses API, and explore what's included "in the box." Through live demos, you'll see how easily you can create solutions using built-in tools, and we’ll conclude by showcasing cutting-edge features such as real-time audio, multi-agent capabilities, and MCP.
